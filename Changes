- Make sure all queries that retrieve one or more stories get the requested_by
  field. Calling $story->requested_by on a story that was retrieved via the
  ->project_stories_where method would fail because this wasn't being done. It
  only worked for a story retrieved with the ->story method.


0.09     2018-01-04

  distribution could not be untarred on Windows at all.

- The Story class now has a ->requested_by method that returns a
  WebService::PivotalTracker::Person object.
